# CNTK4-Time Series-LSTM

# Introduction
CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit), is a deep learning framework developed by Microsoft Research. Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph.

LSTM, which stand for Long Short-Term Memory, are a particular type of recurrent neural networks that got lot of attention recently within the machine learning community. In a simple way, LSTM networks have some internal contextual state cells that act as long-term or short-term memory cells. LSTM is widely used for sequential type of data.

# Problem Statement
This project is going to demonstrate how to use CNTK to predict future values in a time series using LSTMs by simulating dataset.

# Data Summary
Time series problem will use simulated data set of a continuous function. For details, we generate multiple such instances of the input signal (by sampling from sin function) each of size N and the corresponding desired output as our training data. 

# Algorithms
LSTM, is a particular type of recurrent neural networks that got lot of attention recently within the machine learning community. In a simple way, LSTM networks have some internal contextual state cells that act as long-term or short-term memory cells.

# Approach
1. Data reading: We generate simulated data sets.

2. Data preprocessing:  visualize the generated data

 3. Model creation: LSTM.
 
4. Evaluation: validate and test error

# Conclusion
The time series we build is not perfect but close enough.
