# TensorFlow

# Introduction
TensorFlow does the same work as NumPy, but instead of returning to Python every time, it creates all the operations in the form of graphs and execute them once with the highly optimized backend.

# Problem Statement
To repressent a sepecific image in tensorflow for a better view. 

# Approach
I will firstly Load sample image and check the image information. And we can see that the data of the image is a numeric matrix and the numbers represent the color indexes of the pixels.

# Conclusion
For the image recognition project, in the original example, there are two filters are created, one for vertical line and one for horizontal line. I firstly try these two filters separately, and then try to use them together to show the whole picture by combining the vertical and horizontal line, which can give better showing.
