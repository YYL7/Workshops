Customer reviews -- Fuji x100f (mirrorless camera)

The project is to use sentiment analysis to help me analyze the popularity of a mirrorless camera by customer reviews.


Through the scatter plot, we can see that the sentiment average is not that high. 


So, maybe I need to reconsider and do more research before buying a camera.
